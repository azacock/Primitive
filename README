Primitive is a WIP mod that adds a range of building materials, ranging from neolithic to early medieval, as well as immersive processes for their creation. Many of these materials are accessible without the use of stone or metal. These materials and mechanics are design to fill the content gap of very early game, and to assist modpack developers to want to introduce a stone-age tier of progression to their packs. This tier may initially seem dull, but I believe there is engaging gameplay to be found there.
